# NoTeX
NoTeX is a lightweight TeX editor made for Computer Science and Mathematics students. With a focus on fast and intuitive note-taking, NoTeX provides students with a way to visually see the TeX they are writing. It is written in C++, linking with the project [pdf2svg](https://github.com/dawbarton/pdf2svg) to create Scalable Vector Graphics (SVGs) to allow resizing of individual LaTeX components. The GUI is written in GTKmm, a C++ API for GTK.

## Projected Milestones:

1. June 28th - Created a line of communication between developers.

2. July 12th - ~~Finalizing the choices in data structure for overlaying text and images with a partial (or complete!) implementation.~~ (Realized this didn't make sense without first looking into how GTK worked. Spent this time looking into GTK and playing around with it instead.) Have looked into GTK, played around with it, and looked at how to create streamlined GTK development.

3. July 19th - Finish basic GUI that allows for text editing / saving, as well as inserting and resizing images.

4. July 26th - Implement hotkeys, a basic settings menu, and editing / opening / saving.

5. August 2nd - Continue looking into how to integrate the text and images in GTK.

6. August 9th - Crude implementation of the core feature implemented.

7. August 23rd - Core feature fully fleshed out with a more polished GUI. Documentation is present and generated.
